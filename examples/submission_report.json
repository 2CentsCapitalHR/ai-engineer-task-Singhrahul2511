                        "issue": "Section 13.2(a) states that the Company may terminate the employment with immediate effect for cause if the Employee has committed a breach constituting a ground for summary dismissal in accordance with Section 56(1) of the ADGM Employment Regulations.  However, the provided ADGM Legal Context mentions Section 57(1).  There is a discrepancy in section numbers.",

This could lead to non-compliance with other aspects of the regulations not specifically mentioned.",

This needs to align with the ADGM Employment Regulations' requirements for probationary periods.",
